# Overview
This is a simple Python script for generating random passwords. The script prompts the user to input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password and then generates a random password accordingly.

# Features
- Generates random passwords based on user input.
- Allows customisation of the password length and composition (letters, symbols, and numbers).
- Randomises the order of characters in the generated password to enhance security.

# Fun Fact
Passwords generated using a combination of letters, symbols and numbers are much more difficult to crack for hackers using brute force. What is brute force? Brute force attacks involve trying all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.

# Here is why these kinds of passwords are more secure

- Increased Complexity: Including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), symbols, and numbers significantly increases the complexity of the password. This results in a larger search space for the attacker, making it more difficult and time-consuming to try all possible combinations.
- Entropy: The presence of different types of characters increases the entropy of the password, which is a measure of its randomness and unpredictability. Higher entropy passwords are harder to crack using brute force methods.
- Compliance and Best Practices: Many security standards and best practices recommend or require the use of complex passwords with a mix of characters to enhance security and mitigate the risk of brute force attacks.
